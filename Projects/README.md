📁 [View Project Folder](DrownSaver-anti-drowning-device)

**Completed: March 2019**

- **Objective:**  
  Design and develop a wearable safety device that helps prevent drowning by automatically inflating a flotation airbag and notifying lifeguards when drowning behavior is detected.

- **Tools & Techniques:**  
  Arduino Pro Mini, tilt/vibration sensor, servo motor, CO₂ cartridge, Bluetooth module, 18650 Li-ion battery, Embedded C, MIT App Inventor, Waterfall methodology.

- **Results / Key Findings:**  
  - Achieved 100% reliability during experimental trials  
  - Successful automatic and manual airbag inflation  
  - Real-time Bluetooth alerts sent to lifeguards up to 10 meters  
  - Positive evaluation from lifeguards in reliability, functionality, usability, and efficiency

- **Learnings:**  
  - Embedded systems design and hardware–software integration  
  - Sensor-based event detection and automation  
  - Bluetooth communication between devices and mobile apps
